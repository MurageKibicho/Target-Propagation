# Target Propagation: A Biologically Plausible Neural Network Training Algorithm

This repo contains code to train a neural network via Target Propagation. The code is explained on LeetArxiv at this [link](https://leetarxiv.substack.com/p/target-propagation).

# Results
Target propagation takes 5 minutes to achieve 39% accuracy on MNIST on CPU. 

It is extremely slow tbh. I guess this is why it failed to go mainstream post-2015.
